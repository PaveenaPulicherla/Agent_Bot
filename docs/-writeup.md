# Assignment Write-Up: Discord QA Agent Bot

For the technology-focused option of this assignment, I created a lightweight Discord-based agent prototype designed to simulate core behaviors of an AI QA & Governance system. The bot demonstrates agentic workflows such as test generation, hallucination detection, compliance evaluation, and QA reporting.

The bot was developed using the Discord Developer Portal and the discord.py library. Once deployed, the bot responds to user commands inside a private Discord server. Each command represents a core capability of an AI QA agent.

This prototype shows how agentic systems can automate repetitive QA tasks, support governance workflows, and provide consistent evaluation outputs. It also highlights how agentic systems can be embedded into existing communication platforms to support real-time collaboration.
